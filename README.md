## Description

### JavaScript Button

Renders a button, and allows you to run some custom JS on click of that button.
Does not require a context object.

### JavaScript Microflow Button

Renders a button, and allows you to run some custom JS on click of that button. After the JS executes, a microflow is also called. Custom JS can also be run after the microflow.

Requires a context object.

In this button, you can get a reference to the context object by using:

```
this._contextObj
```

You can get the data in an attribute of your context entity like this:
```
var myValue = this._contextObj.get("AttributeName");
```

And you can set the data in an attribute of your contenxt entity like this:
```
this._contextObj.set("AttributeName", newValue);
```
